 * code to release the buffers.
 *
 *
 * For all the buffers on this page,
 * if they are fully written out ordered data, move them onto BUF_CLEAN
 * so try_to_free_buffers() can reap them.
 *
 * This function returns non-zero if we wish try_to_free_buffers()
 * to be called. We do this if the page is releasable by try_to_free_buffers().
 * We also do it if the page has locked or dirty buffers and the caller wants
 * us to perform sync or async writeout.
 *
 * This complicates JBD locking somewhat.  We aren't protected by the
 * BKL here.  We wish to remove the buffer from its committing or
 * running transaction's ->t_datalist via __zj_journal_unfile_buffer.
 *
 * This may *change* the value of ztransaction_t->t_datalist, so anyone
 * who looks at t_datalist needs to lock against this function.
 *
 * Even worse, someone may be doing a zj_journal_dirty_data on this
 * buffer.  So we need to lock against that.  zj_journal_dirty_data()
 * will come out of the lock with the buffer dirty, which makes it
 * ineligible for release here.
 *
 * Who else is affected by this?  hmm...  Really the only contender
 * is do_get_write_access() - it could be looking at the buffer while
 * zjournal_try_to_free_buffer() is changing its state.  But that
 * cannot happen because we never reallocate freed data as metadata

 * zj_journal_invalidatepage
 *
 * This code is tricky.  It has a number of cases to deal with.
 *
 * There are two invariants which this code relies on:
 *
 * i_size must be updated on disk before we start calling invalidatepage on the
 * data.
 *
 *  This is done in ext3 by defining an ext3_setattr method which
 *  updates i_size before truncate gets going.  By maintaining this
 *  invariant, we can be sure that it is safe to throw away any buffers
 *  attached to the current transaction: once the transaction commits,
 *  we know that the data will not be needed.
 *
 *  Note however that we can *not* throw away data belonging to the
 *  previous, committing transaction!
 *
 * Any disk blocks which *are* part of the previous, committing
 * transaction (and which therefore cannot be discarded immediately) are
 * not going to be reused in the new running transaction
 *
 *  The bitmap committed_data images guarantee this: any block which is
 *  allocated in one transaction and removed in the next will be marked
 *  as in-use in the committed_data bitmap, so cannot be reused until
 *  the next transaction to delete the block commits.  This means that
 *  leaving committing buffers dirty is quite safe: the disk blocks
 *  cannot be reallocated to a different file and so buffer aliasing is
 *  not possible.
 *
 *
 * The above applies mainly to ordered data mode.  In writeback mode we
 * don't make guarantees about the order in which data hits disk --- in
 * particular we don't guarantee that new dirty data is flushed before
 * transaction commit --- so it is always safe just to discard data
 * immediately in that mode.  --sct
